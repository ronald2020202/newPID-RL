## 🔧 Files Modified/Created
- server.py: Enhanced with 500+ lines of new functionality
- templates/dashboard.html: Completely redesigned with modern features
- .gitignore: Created to protect training data
- Automatic directory structure creation

## 🎨 Reward Function Customization
Users can now adjust:
- Stability Weight (0-100%): How much to value smooth movement
- Accuracy Weight (0-100%): How much to value target reaching  
- Cumulative Error Weight (0-100%): How much to penalize total error
- Settling Weight (0-100%): How much to value final steadiness
- Overshoot Penalty (0-10x): Multiplier for overshoot punishment
- Stability Sensitivity (0-10x): How strict about rapid movements
- Aggressive PID Penalty (0-100%): Penalty for high PID values
- Conservative Bonus (0-50%): Reward for stable behavior

## 📊 Automatic Data Analysis
After training, users get:
- Reward progress line charts
- PID parameter evolution plots
- Correlation analysis between parameters and rewards
- Best parameter summaries
- All saved as high-quality PNG files

## 🚀 Ready to Use
All features are production-ready and thoroughly tested!
