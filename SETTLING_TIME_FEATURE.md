# Settling Time Enhancement Added

## 🎯 New Feature: Time Until Stability Reward

### What It Does:
- Measures how quickly the system reaches and maintains a stable position
- Rewards systems that settle faster
- Penalizes systems that never reach stability

### Algorithm:
1. **Settling Detection**: System is 'settled' when error stays within threshold for a continuous time window
2. **Time Measurement**: Records the time from start until first stable period
3. **Reward Calculation**: Linear reward - faster settling = higher reward
4. **No Overshoot Rule**: Settling time is only counted if no overshoot occurs during the settling window

### Configurable Parameters:
- **⏱️ Settling Time Weight (0-100%)**: How much to value fast settling time
- **🎯 Settling Threshold (0.5-10°)**: Error threshold to consider 'settled' (lower = stricter)
- **⏳ Settling Window (0.2-3.0s)**: Time that must stay within threshold (longer = more stable)

### Example Scenarios:
- **Fast settler**: Reaches 2° error in 1.5s and stays there → High reward
- **Slow settler**: Takes 6s to reach 2° error → Lower reward  
- **Never settles**: Oscillates throughout test → Zero settling time reward
- **Overshoots**: Reaches target but overshoots in settling window → Zero settling time reward

### Integration:
- Added to existing 5-component reward system (now 6 components)
- Weight distribution updated: Stability 40%, Accuracy 20%, Cumulative 15%, Settling 15%, Settling Time 10%
- Full webapp slider control with real-time updates
- Professional logging and analysis in matplotlib plots

Ready to train PID systems that prioritize both stability AND speed\! 🚀
